# MLE / MAP and Logistic Regression (From Scratch)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook covering:
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
- Logistic Regression implemented from scratch
- (Optional) Tweet sentiment classification using NLTK

## File
- `MLE_MAP_LR.ipynb`

## Topics
- Gaussian noise simulation
- MLE vs MAP intuition
- Logistic Regression:
  - Sigmoid
  - Cost function with regularization
  - Gradients and gradient descent
  - Decision boundary visualization

## Requirements
Python 3.9+

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn nltk jupyter
## Notes
This project is educational and focuses on understanding statistical estimation and logistic regression.
